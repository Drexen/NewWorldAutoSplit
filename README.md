# New World AutoSplit

For use with

LiveSplit: https://livesplit.org/

AutoSplit: https://github.com/Toufool/AutoSplit/


AutoSplit is resolution specific so these images will only work if you run your game at 2560x1440 resolution. I use the default similarity threshold (0.90) and default pause time (2.00s). Make sure to set X/Y to 0 and Width/Height to 2560x1440.


Status (how well I find the autosplit works for each expedition)

Barnacles - Good

Depths - Alright

Dynasty - Good

Ennead - Good

Genesis - Good

Lazarus - Good

Starstone - Bad

Tempest - Good
